## Places to Meet

- **[Interactive map](public/places-map.html)** — color-coded Leaflet map of all venues.
- **[Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING-places.md)** — how to add or suggest a place.
- **[Suggest a place](https://github.com/mgifford/OSW_plus/issues/new?template=submit-place.yml)** — quick GitHub Issue form.
